It describes the task of predicting sub-cellular locations of proteins in organism according to their sequences. However, compared to GO datasets it represents the protein samples using pseudo amino acid composition including 20 amino-acid, 20 pseudo-amino acid and 400 dipeptide components. The labels are the subcellular locations where a protein may appear. These numbers are different depending on the organism at interest.", "name": "VirusPseAAC", "identifier": ["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2016.01.032", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705116000526"],"license": "na"}

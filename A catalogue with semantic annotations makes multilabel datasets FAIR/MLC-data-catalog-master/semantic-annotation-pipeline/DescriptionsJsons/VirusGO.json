It describes the task of predicting sub-cellular locations of proteins in different organisms according to their protein sequences. The software \"BLAST\" (Basic local alignment search tool) is applied to each protein sequence from the Swiss-Prot database. The homologous proteins that have great pairwise sequence identity are collected into sets with accession numbers. Each of those accession numbers is matched with the Gene Ontology (GO) database. Then a binary feature vector is constructed such that if GO number is present the element in the vector representing the protein has the value of 1, otherwise 0. The labels are the sub-cellular locations where a protein may appear. These numbers are different depending on the organism at interest.", "creator": [{"url": "https://www.mendeley.com/authors/57194768618/", "name": "Jianhua Xu"}, {"url": "https://www.mendeley.com/authors/57113934100/", "name": "Chengyu Sun"}], "keywords": ["Multi-label classification", "Dimensionality reduction", "Feature extraction", "Principal component analysis", "Hilbert\u2013Schmidt independence criterion", "Eigenvalue problem"],"license": "na"}

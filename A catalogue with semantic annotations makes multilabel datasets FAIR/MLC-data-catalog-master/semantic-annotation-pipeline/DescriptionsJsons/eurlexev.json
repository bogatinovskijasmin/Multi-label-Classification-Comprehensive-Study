It includes 19596 documents related to secondary lawand international agreements. Regarding the legal form the acts are moslty decisions, regulations, directives and agreements. Each of the document is assigned with several EUROVOC tags. The feature construction and preprocessing is done as follows: the text is extracted from the HTML documents, excluding HTML tags, bibliograpghic notes or other additional information. The text is thantokenized into lower case, stop words are excluded and the porter stemmer algortihm is used. The words are projeted into the vector space model using TF-IDF term weighting. The first 5000 features are selected to reduce the memory requirments. ","license": "na"}

{"description": "Yelp} is dataset from the text domain. It is concerned with the classification of reviews from customers for restaurants into relevant categories. There are two groups of features, star ratings (represented by binary variables) and textual features consisting of unigrams, bigrams and trigrams. The textual features are extracted in such a way that after downcasing all the words and removing special characters the unigrams, bigrams and trigrams are extracted and their frequency among reviews is recorded. Only the ones that have their frequency above the threshold of 300 are preserved. The labels represent the abstractions the review refers to. The meaning of the label-sets is a multiple of Food, Service, Ambiance, Deals/Discounts, Worthiness.", "keywords": ["Multi-label classification"], "creator": [{"url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o4gwhssAAAAJ&hl=en", "name": "Hitesh Sajnani"}, {"url": "https://www.ics.uci.edu/~lopes/", "name": "\tCristina Videira Lopes"}], "name": "Yelp", "sameAs": ["http://mondego.ics.uci.edu/projects/yelp/", "http://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#YelpDesc"], "identifier": ["http://mondego.ics.uci.edu/projects/yelp/files/technical_report.pdf"],"license": "na"}

They describe the problem of sub-cellular localization. As input are taken the sequence descriptors of the proteins for  humans, virus, plant. The calculation of the features is done with the \"propy\" library. The library takes as input the protein sequences and uses the default settings of the methods used to extract the features. The features describe structural and physio-chemical properties of the proteins and some of them include amino acid compositions, dipeptide compositions, transition, Moran auto-correlation, distributions, sequence-order-coupling numbers etc.", "creator": [{"name": "Hang Zhou", "url": "None"}, {"name": "Hong-Bin Shen", "url": "https://dblp.org/pers/hd/s/Shen:Hong=Bin"}], "keywords": ["Machine Learning", "Multi-label classification"], "sameAs": ["http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/Hum-mPLoc3/"],"license": "na"}

{"name": "Eukaryote_PSEACC", "description": "Eukaryote_PSEACC is a dataset from the area of bioinformatics.  It describes the task of predicting subcellular locations of proteins in organism according to their sequences. However, compared to GO datasets it represents the protein samples using a pseudo amino acid composition including 20 amino-acid, 20 pseudo-amino acid and 400 dipeptide components. The labels are the subcellular locations where a protein may appear. These numbers are different depending on the organism at interest.", "sameAs": ["https://cometa.ujaen.es/datasets/EukaryotePseAAC", "http://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#Eukaryote"], "identifier": ["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2016.01.032", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705116000526"], "keywords": ["Multi-label classification", "Dimensionality reduction", "Feature extraction", "Principal component analysis", "Hilbert\u2013Schmidt independence criterion", "Eigenvalue problem"], "creator": [{"name": "Jianhua Xu", "url": "https://www.mendeley.com/authors/57194768618/"}, {"name": "Chengyu Sun", "url": "https://www.mendeley.com/authors/57113934100/"}], "license": "na"}

{"name": "nuswide_vlad", "description": "It differs from nuswide_BoW approach in the way how the local features calculated from the images are calculated. Instead of using the BoW representation the VLAD representation that encodes higher-order statistics, compared to BoW, of the distribution of features to visual words. The preprocessing procedure further involves power and L2 normalization as a manual way of preprocessing the images. The preprocessing procedure generates 128 features and there are 81 labels.", "sameAs": ["https://cometa.ujaen.es/datasets/nuswide_VLAD", "http://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#NusWideDesc", "http://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets-mlc.html"], "identifier": ["http://lpis.csd.auth.gr/publications/spyromitrosIEEETMM2014.pdf", "10.1109/TMM.2014.2329648"], "keywords": ["Multi-label classification", "Image retrieval", "indexing", "image classification"], "creator": [{"name": "Grigorios Tsoumakas", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PlGKUhwAAAAJ&hl=en"}, {"name": "Ioannis Vlahavas", "url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xHIjg7EAAAAJ&hl=en"}], "license": "na"}

{"name": "image", "description": "This dataset is composed by 2,000 images. Concretely, each color image is firstly converted to the CIE Luv space, which is a more perceptually uniform color space such that perceived color differences correspond closely to Euclidean distances in this color space. After that, the image is divided into 49 blocks using a 7\u00d77 grid, where in each block the first and second moments (mean and variance) of each band are computed, corresponding to a low-resolution image and to computationally inexpensive texture features respectively. Finally, each image is transformed into a 49\u00d73\u00d72 = 294-dimensional feature vector.", "sameAs": ["http://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#ImdbDesc"], "identifier": ["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2006.12.019"], "keywords": ["Machine learning", "Multi-label learning", "Lazy learning", "K-nearest neighbor", "Functional genomics", "Natural scene classification", "Text categorization"], "creator": [{"name": "Min-Ling Zhang", "url": "https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=uFHCIM0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"}, {"name": "Zhi-Hua Zhou", "url": "https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=rSVIHasAAAAJ&hl=en"}], "license": "na"}

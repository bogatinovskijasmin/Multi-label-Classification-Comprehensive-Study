It describes the task of predicting sub-cellular locations of proteins in organism according to their sequences. However, compared to GO datasets it represents the protein samples using pseudo amino acid composition including 20 amino-acid, 20 pseudo-amino acid and 400 dipeptide components. The labels are the subcellular locations where a protein may appear. These numbers are different depending on the organism at interest.", "name": "HumanPseAAC", "sameAs": ["https://cometa.ujaen.es/datasets/HumanGO", "http://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#HumanDesc"], "keywords": ["Multi-label classification", "Dimensionality reduction", "Feature extraction", "Principal component analysis", "Hilbert\u2013Schmidt independence criterion", "Eigenvalue problem"], "creator": [{"url": "https://www.mendeley.com/authors/57194768618/", "name": "Jianhua Xu"}, {"url": "https://www.mendeley.com/authors/57113934100/", "name": "Chengyu Sun"}],"license": "na"}

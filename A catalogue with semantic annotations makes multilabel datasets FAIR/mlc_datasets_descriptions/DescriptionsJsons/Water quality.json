{"description": "Water Quality is dataset containing descriptions about the biological properties of a river. The features represent the different concentration of chemical components, such as biological oxygen demand, electrical conductivity, chemical oxygen demand, concentrations of different elements and compounds, water temperature and total hardness. The labels are represented by 14 taxa present at the sampling sites and their density. This dataset belongs to the domain of chemistry.", "sameAs": ["http://www.uco.es/kdis/mllresources/#WaterQualityDesc"], "creator": [{"url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Eq5sUNpp0gwC&hl=en", "name": "Hendrik Blockeel"}, {"url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_aIV-aEAAAAJ&hl=en", "name": "Saso Dzeroski"}], "name": "Water quality", "identifier": ["https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-48247-5_4", "10.1007/978-3-540-48247-5_4"], "keywords": ["Chemical Oxygen Demand", "Biological Oxygen Demand", "River Water Quality", "Inductive Logic Programming", "Inductive Logic Programming System"]}

{"name": "genbase", "description": "Genbase is a dataset that contains protein sequences and its functional family labels. Since a protein sequence can have multiple functions the problem can be defined as a MLC task. Each protein sequence is mapped to an attribute vector. Since each protein sequence contains some motifs thus it can be represented as a set of 1's and 0's depending on the presence or absence of the motif in the sequence. The labels are grouped in the 10 most common families.  The labels are the classes: oxidoreductases, isomerases, cytokines and growth factors, structural proteins, receptors, DNA or RNA associated proteins, transferals, protein secretion and chaperoned, hydrolysis. GenMiner is used as a tool to prepare the data.
